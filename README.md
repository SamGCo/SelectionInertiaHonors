# Choice overload's effect on Adverse Selection and Inertia Honors Research

This is my senior honor's thesis project where I am investigating the relationship of choice overload has with inertia and adverse selection in the ACA exchanges.<br/>

RA-1 is a script that imports risk adjustment data to then create a dataframe with the states and the absolute value sum of risk adjustment transfers divided by two in each state. <br/>
RA-2 is a script that takes insurance filing data to create a dataframe with the number of markets per state and then the number of plans per state to then create a dataframe where I have each state with the average number of plans per market per state to then run a regression with the risk adjustment sum from the last script.
